**Justification for Visualization Choice (Question 2):**
A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables (GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita).

A regression line can help quantify the trend.

## 6. Inference or Conclusion

Based on the visualizations and analyses performed:

* **Regarding Question 1 ([Summarize finding for Q1]):** [e.g., We observed a clear upward trend in CO2 emissions for developing nations like China and India over the past two decades, while some developed nations showed stabilization or slight decreases.]
* **Regarding Question 2 ([Summarize finding for Q2]):** [e.g., A positive correlation was found between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita, though the strength of this relationship varies, and many factors influence it. Interactive exploration highlighted some countries that deviate from the general trend.]
* **Regarding Question 3 ([Summarize finding for Q3]):** [e.g., The distribution of CO2 emissions is highly skewed, with a small number of countries/regions contributing the majority of the global total. Asia, driven by a few large economies, is currently the largest emitting continent.]

**Overall Insights:**
[e.g., The exploration of this dataset reveals significant disparities and dynamic changes in global CO2 emissions. While economic development appears linked to emissions, the path to sustainable development requires decoupling economic growth from emission increases. Further analysis could investigate the impact of policy interventions or technological changes.]

**Limitations:**
[e.g., The dataset might have limitations in terms of reporting accuracy for some countries or years. This analysis focused primarily on CO2 and did not include other greenhouse gases. The definition of 'regions' could also influence regional comparisons.]

*(TODO: Tailor these conclusions to your actual findings.)*
